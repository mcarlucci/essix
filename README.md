Essix
==========
A delightfully quick, simple, bare-bones, client-side ES6+ (ES2015) JavaScript project setup.
This project uses a bare minimum setup to transpile ES6+ code into ES5 code using babel and gulp. Nothing more, nothing less.

What's in the box:
- gulp
- gulp-babel
- gulp-watch

Quick Install & Setup
---------
> **Requirements:**

> - Node.js

From the command line, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/mcarlucci/essix.git myES6AppName
cd myES6AppName && npm install
gulp
```

Visit [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) in your browser to see the transpiled ES6+/ES5 code at work.

src/scripts.js creates and compiles to /dist by default.

Enjoy writing better javascript!
